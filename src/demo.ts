/**
 * Demo: drive one task from DRAFT to PAID — its first submission is
 * REJECTed in QA and RESUBMITted before it passes on re-review — print
 * the append-only audit history, run a second task through the SLA
 * watchdog branch (an advisory deadline passes, `expiredTasks()`
 * screening finds the task, and a watchdog explicitly dispatches
 * EXPIRE into the EXPIRED terminal state), then build the signed
 * payout webhook for the settled task and verify it the way a
 * receiver would.
 *
 * Usage: `npm run demo` (builds with tsc, then runs node on the compiled
 * output). Zero runtime dependencies: this file only imports the state
 * machine itself.
